    <h2>Portfolio Website</h2>
    <p><strong>Tools used:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>
    <p>This is the website you're currently viewing. I designed and built it to showcase my skills, projects, and experience. It includes a responsive layout, section toggling, and a downloadable CV.</p>

    <h3>Project Evolution</h3>
    <p>I started with wireframes and a moodboard, then built the layout using semantic HTML and custom CSS. I added JavaScript to make the sections interactive. I also included a contact form and links to my GitHub and LinkedIn.</p>
